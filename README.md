# 🌍 Country Explorer - Frontend Coding Challenge

This project is part of a **Frontend Web Developer coding challenge** provided by [Numbero](https://www.numbero.de/). The goal is to build a small React web app that interacts with a public API and demonstrates core frontend skills like state management, API integration, and user interface design.

**Country Explorer** is a simple web application that allows users to:
